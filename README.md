# LandShares
ERC20 Smart contract for Quantum Impact/ UN susdev goals hackathon


Smart Contract driven project to reduce abuse of farmers by landowners.
Supported by UN, SCs ensure that farmers, at zero risk, can contract to lease land for a period of growing, so that once the international retailer agrees product is delivered, payment is transferred in LandShares token (later will migrate to QI) direct from retailer to both landowner and farmer according to pre-agreed (or pre-defined) split.

To remove potential for duress, once a landowner makes a deposit and the three-way agreement is accepted by a farmer, then the farmer cannot release funds until the delivery date oif the produce.

Retailers put no deposit down and cannot remove offers once placed on blockchain.
Landowners must place deposit on offers made by retailers, specifying exactly which land is to be leased to farmer. Landowners can back out and recieve deposit only if no farmer has accepted.
Farmers put no money down and lock landowner's deposit once they agree to an agreement. After completion date, farmer can release landowner's deposit.
If retailer pays, then landowner and farmer split money and landowner receives deposit.
